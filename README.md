## Overview
This project focuses on the classification of leukemia types using microscopic images. Leukemia is a critical medical condition, and early and accurate diagnosis is crucial for effective treatment. This machine learning project leverages computer vision techniques and deep learning models to classify leukemia types based on microscopic images of blood samples.

## Features
- Utilizes a deep learning model to analyze and classify microscopic images of blood samples.
- Aims to provide accurate and efficient diagnosis of leukemia types, enabling timely medical intervention.
- Includes a loss graph to visualize the training progress of the machine learning model.
- Provides a confusion matrix to assess the model's performance in classifying different leukemia types.
